This extension lets you set up important local business information for search engines to consume.

## Overview

### Higher ranking through local search

A potential customer or visitor often wants to find out more about your business before interacting.
Therefore, for many businesses, local listings are a must.

A local listing within Google will also be placed upfront and sometimes above all other search results.

With the Local SEO extension, you can rank your different local business departments higher in Google and other search engines.
So, your business will be found better by your local customers.

All the above also accounts for users whom add locations in their search query.

### An advanced SEO solution

We present you an advanced and leading Local SEO solution, excelling other existing similar solutions, for a lower price.

**This software package includes:**

* Support for multiple locations (up to 4096, not only 2).
* (Reverse) Geocoding through our API services.
* Options for opening hours per location.
* Internal caching, for significantly faster execution.
* Reservation, menu, and cuisine support for food establishments.
* Multisite support.

The output of your business information is fully automated through Schema.org header scripts.
This means there's no signup required at Google or Bing. This also leads to higher exposure for search engines and visitors alike.

### Is Local SEO for your business?

**This extension is for your business, if:**

* Your business is physically established on one or more locations.
* You want to inform search engine users nearby about your business before they enter your site.
* You want your business to be easily found on certain keywords, like "Italian Restaurant".
* You want your business website to have more authority and search presence.

### How does Local SEO work?

After you've filled in all required information (and saved it), Local SEO will automatically output all set information through Schema.org scripts in your website's header.
These scripts aren't seen on your website by general visitors, but search engine crawlers can interpret this information easily.

Schema.org is a standard set through joint efforts of Google, Bing, Yahoo! and Yandex.

### Fully automated, no sign-up required

When you've acquired a premium subscription for the Extension Manager, the Local SEO extension can connect to our services in the admin area.

We took care of all the API connections with geocoding services, and packaged it within the user interface for a smooth admin experience.

In the end, this saves you a lot of time.

## Usage

[tsfep-bundled]

### Activate Local SEO

First, you'll need to activate the extension.

After activating the extension, you'll find a menu link displayed next to the activation button.
That link will direct you to the Local SEO settings page.

On the Local SEO settings page, you'll find a brief introductory, and right below that you'll find the number of departments options.

### Set number of departments

When your business has one physical location, leave this option set as `1`.

If your business has, for example, a shop inside the restaurant, you might find it useful to annotate them through multiple departments.

If your business has multiple locations, you should also increase the number of departments.

Each of the departments requires almost all information to be set.

### Set up local business information

To begin filling in the required information, start by clicking the department block.
This will expand all the available settings.

What you'll notice directly is that the header will be annotated by a red cross. This means not all required data is set up.
All fields are checked as you fill them in. If they're red, you need to fix the input.

*If you require color vision support, don't worry! The extension will walk you through all incorrect fields when you try to view the markup or save the settings.*

If you are in need for any information regarding a field, hover your mouse over the nearby question mark.

### View markup

If you wish to test out your markup first, you can do so through the **See Markup** button found at the bottom.
A new window will open, with your markup in Google's Structured Data Testing tool.

Through Google's Structured Data Testing Tool, you can see a clean view of the markup.
In the middle, there's a big button. When pressed, Google will parse the data and will highlight mistakes.

When the input is compatible with Google's previewer, you can preview the markup through the **Preview** button.

*Note: The preview button might not always be available, depending on the data filled in or your current location.*

### Saving the data

Finally, when you're all set, you can save the data through the **Save** button found at the bottom.
This will parse and cache all input data for front-end output.

All data will automatically be outputted on the homepage, and will automatically link to any department URLs set.
Also, when department URLs are filled in, then each specific department's data will be outputted accordingly on those pages.
