== Changelog ==

TODO Make "No valid license key was supplied" warning site-wide, instead of only Extension Manager page.

TODO: For Honeypot Timer, add a JS script that updates the timer when the page loads.
	-> If no JS, just keep the server-timer.
	-> If emptied -> fail!
	-> Use the same method PHP uses.

TODO figure out why TSFEM crashes on post-save (keyword email: Andy).

TODO when visiting the Extension Manager page, the notice notifyer isn't counted down
	-> Can this even be fixed? Maybe only when counting down to 0.
		-> Though, this issue could actually help users understand that the notifyer badge is for notifications...

TODO update pot file.

TODO test if TSF's installer still works with WP 6.5
	-> Yes, but slowly for some reason (might be a fluke, tested 1x).
	-> Also, the installer buttons don't "sync" when installed via the tickbox, but this is a non-issue.
		-> Solve in next update?
			-> Does this only affect the plugin activation page?
		-> Remove the "install" button and only show "view details" instead? This will be a bit more intuitive and familiar for the user.

TODO make a separate loader specifically when TSF is inactive (load installer + updater).
	-> And only when TSF is active and at the right version, load the main plugin.
		-> Here, we can freely assume TSF is available.
	-> We already do this, but it's not as clear as can be.

TODO use TSF's memo API?

TODO deJquerify as much as possible.
	TODO definitely replace tsf-updated-gutenberg-

TODO for transport, write the log to wp-content (in chunks?).
	-> Do this even when not sending data to the browser.
	-> Make a link to download the logs?
		-> And to delete them?
			-> Use a default format. Be wary of path traversal.

TODO remove _init_final_static_extension_api_access.

TODO require tsf and tsfem dependencies for all scripts
	-> This eases debugging, e.g. via tsf.l10n.states.debug.

TODO remove uptime monitoring toggles, it never would've worked out anyway.

TODO the "logo guidelines" link needs updating.
	-> Just add an entry to our FAQ instead, Google's site keeps updating and it's annoying.

TODO myMart and myMart Pharmacy isn't clear, they should be separated.
	-> Remove the brackets in `{store name} {department name}`,
		-> and make it `store name` OR `store name department name`

TODO trailing commas

TODO we can use is_wp_version_compatible() and is_php_version_compatible() now.
	-> is_wp_version_compatible() doesn't use an unadulterated version of wp_version
		-> https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/61781
TODO wp_get_wp_version() is now available for $wp_version.
	-> This is WP 6.7+. Just add TODOs or make a helper function to bridge this (if ! function_exists('wp_get_wp_version')...)

TODO indexnow, when?
	-> https://theseoframework.com/changelog/5-0-5/

TODO for Articles, exclude the default post state. If the article type is disabled, we should state "no article type" or similar.
	-> edge case.

TODO use `PHP_INT_SIZE === 4 ? 32 : 64` for bit testing?

TODO this will be 3.0.0... so, you know, update 2.7.0 -> 3.0.0

TODO considering writing out how we're going to add automated internal linking.
	-> We could preemptively write links in the articles as they're being written. This opens the doors for special processing.
	-> Alternatively, we could dynamically add them after the article is written. This must then be super lenient.

= 3.0.0 =

* June TODOth, 2024

**Feature highlights:**

* Honeypot now tests against fast commenters that accelerate time virtually.
* Focus can now make API calls again when creating a new post using the latest Block Editor.

**Tip:**
This update comes with updated browser styles and scripts. Not all browsers get these for you; so, you may get unexpected errors. Try a different browser, or clear your favorite browser's cache. That ought to fix it immediately.

These keyboard shortcuts should help you with that. Visit the page giving errors, and hit:

- Safari Mac: <span class="nowrap"><kbd>CMD ⌘</kbd>+<kbd>OPTION ⌥</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd></span>
- Chrome/Firefox Mac: <span class="nowrap"><kbd>CMD ⌘</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT ⇧</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd></span>
- Windows: <span class="nowrap"><kbd>CTRL ^</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT ⇧</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd></span>
- Linux: <kbd>CTRL ^</kbd>+<kbd>Alt ⌥</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>, good luck.

**Detailed log:**

* **The plugin database version is now at `2700`.**
* **Note:** Downgrading to an earlier version of this plugin might cause all extensions to become deactivated.
* **Note:** We overhauled how we handle AJAX notices. The scripts in your browser may be outdated after updating.
* **Changed:**
	* We decoupled the active extensions option from the API activation options. This means that extensions will no longer be deactivated after a full disconnect (e.g., after site migration).
	* The update API now engages even if WordPress is not checking this specific plugin. We found that users still accidentally downgraded to the WordPress.org version because of Core issues [44118](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44118) and [61055](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/61055).
	* When your subscription expires or is pending, you no longer need to reconnect manually, but there's now a grace period of 7 days for Extension Manager to reconnect automatically.
		* Once this grace period is passed, your account will need to be upgraded manually again.
		* Automatic reconnecting is tried every 2 minutes.
		* You are also offered to manually switch the license key during this grace period.
* **Improved:**
	* We changed the WordPress version compatibility test by using an unmodified variable, instead of one plugins can alter.
	* We modernized critical JavaScript code, slightly improving browser interaction performance.
	* We modernized some CSS code, slightly reducing the plugin file sizes.
	* We modernized some PHP code, slightly improving server response times.
* **Removed:**
	* "SEO Trends and Updates" are no longer available. We had different plans for what would've been displayed (i.e., our own news feed), but it devolved into a marketing channel for Google unintentionally.
		* The transient data for this (`tsfem_latest_seo_feed`) will be cleaned up automatically by WordPress.
		* The option `_enable_feed` will disappear when the next API status request is made (or another change is made to the account).
* **Fixed:**
	* Resolved an issue where the plugin updater could cause a fatal error.
	* Resolved an issue where extension post-metadata could be double-unserialized by another plugin or store incoherent data on extraction failure.
	* Resolved an issue where API activation via a constant (`TSF_EXTENSION_MANAGER_API_INFORMATION`) could cause a site to get stuck in instance verification failure. Now, the site disconnects and reconnects automatically.
		* This should happen immediately, but there is a timeout of 3 minutes when this keeps recurring. Then, those who can manage Extension Manager can manually enter "Free" mode.
		* The site will upgrade automatically after 3 minutes, regardless of whether it's was set manually into "Free" mode.
* **Other:**
	* Another year has turned. So, we updated all files' copyright coverage.
